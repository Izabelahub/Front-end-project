# Front-end-project

I created a website which allows other people to find out more about mathematical embroidery as well as show courses which can be sold.

The files needed to run the project:
- img
- about.html
- contact.html
- course.html
- index.html
- style.css

The Word document "SDS_learning_diary" shows my learning progress thorough the course. <br>
The video shows my website both on laptop and iPhone SE - the aim is to show the responsiveness.
