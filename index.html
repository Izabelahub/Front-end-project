    <h1>What is mathematical embroidery?</h1>
    <p>Mathematical embroidery is a graphic image made in a special way with threads on thicker paper or other hard substrate. 
        To create it, you can use ordinary threads, mouline threads or strings - preferably colored ones. Embroidery consists 
        in threading a thread according to a fixed pattern. You can do it as a hobby or create cards for special occasions.</p>

                <p>I took the Intermediate course since I didn't feel like a beginner since sewing clothes is my job. In my opinion the course covered everything 
                    I needed in order to know how to master my mathematical embroidery skills. I wish the price was lower although the content is definitely worth the money.</p>

                <p>I really enjoyed the Beginner course and I highly recommend it! I had a chance to learn how to make cards and it became my new hobby. I love gifting my homemade 
                    cards to my family for several occasions. Such a card is the best present ever because I can easily personalize it!</p>
